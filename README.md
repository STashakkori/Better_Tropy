# Better_Tropy
Improved the Tropy entropy tool since it uses RGB coloring and that sucks. Added features as well. -ST

I keep saying it but this is why using RGB type coloring schemes is bad for console programs:

When the intention was to look like this:

So I rewrote the rendering logic and added some small features so Tropy looks like this now:

Now it uses standard 256 color ansi codes AND has increased resolution AND has block measurements.

To use the measurements to calculate where in the file you are:
Multiply block size by the offset then add that to the ruler. If you look it enough you'll see. :]
